# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses, hugs and kisses, and many other names, is a
pencil-and-paper game for two players, O and X, who take turns marking the spaces in a
3Ã—3 grid, usually X going first. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks
in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. -- Wikipedia
The computer displays a Tic Tac Toe grid, and allows two people to play the game.
